# Journal — November 2021

This week, I enjoyed reading the articles “Never Forget: Your Course is Not Only Yours” and “Is Online Test-Monitoring Here to Stay?”  I found them both interesting, as they addressed topics that we have discussed before in some of our CDL meetings last year regarding student privacy and accessibility concerns. 

I liked the way that the post from THE Campus shed light on how faculty members and instructional designers should perhaps make more of an effort to adapt their courses/course design so that they benefit the “public good”. I would agree that making sure that students’ needs are being met should be a priority, among whatever content they are teaching. For example, I think the new Gen. Ed. requirements that Geneseo plans on implementing next year are a step in the right direction, as they would actively help to ensure that students are getting an education in areas such as diversity and sustainability. I think it would be nice for students to have more reasoning as to why they are taking all of these classes; I think it would be better than my own personal experience, in which I often feel as though I am just taking random classes to hit those requirements. 

Unfortunately, I was not surprised at all to read what I did in the New Yorker article. I remember how big of an issue these online test-monitoring services were during the COVID-19 pandemic; almost daily, I would see fellow college students complaining about them on Twitter, whether a minor inconvenience had occurred or an important exam was automatically failed due to a biased algorithm.  Although, I was shocked by the story of the C.E.O. of Proctorio (Mike Olsen) making a fake Reddit account to harass a student who had shared her poor experience with the service — that was crazy to me! I also found it (for lack of a better word) gross how little Olsen seems to care about students’ accessibility and privacy. He claims to agree that the service is invasive, but does not know where he would “draw the line”. Overall, I still found this article fascinating.

On an unrelated note, I tried to follow the Microsoft Word exercise in Module 3, but I could not get it to work for some reason.
